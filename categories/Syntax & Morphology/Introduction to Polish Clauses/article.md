# The Syntax of Relative Clauses in Polish

Relative clauses are a fundamental structure in natural language, allowing for embedded descriptions of noun phrases. In Polish, as in many Slavic languages, the syntax of such constructions reveals rich morphosyntactic alignment and word order flexibility.

## Overview

This article explores the structure of relative clauses using corpus data and native speaker intuitions. We examine:

- The use of **relative pronouns** such as _który_
- Agreement patterns in gender and case
- Non-standard constructions in spoken Polish

## Example

> *Kobieta, która przyszła, była nauczycielką.*  
> “The woman who came was a teacher.”

Note the agreement between _kobieta_ (feminine noun) and _która_ (feminine relative pronoun).
